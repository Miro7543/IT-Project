                         In 1959 The Conservative government started planning on joining the EEC (European Economic Community). The reason for this action was the unsteady economic growth of Britain. They first joined the EFTA (European Free Trade Association) in 1961. After that Britain tried to enter the Common Market but was rejected ny the French Leader Charles De Gualle in 1963. The Reason for that was the close relationship of Britain with Washington. This was a problem as one one of the reasons of creating the EEC was to make it the third superpower between USA ans USSR. But in 1969 after the resignation of Charles De Gualle there was a great opportunity for Britain to join the EEC.

                        The British Empire was the greatest Empire ever created. It had both the most population and area in the History of all Empires. Even though it was the strongest Empire after India and Pakistan got their independence all of the other colonies soon followed. They started rebeling against the British Empire in hopes to get their independence as well. This lead to numerous rebellions and battles for freedom. The Empire couldn't keep up with the rebellions and one by one all colonies got their independence leading to the Fall of The British Empire

                        After the wars the Labour government was elected and as no surpise they set about creating the Welfare State as they were supporting the working class. The difference this time is that they were planning to complete it. The idea of the 'Welfare State' is to let the Central Government together with loacl authorities deal with the social problems and to take responsibility of fixing them. The priority was to maintain a high level of employment through the nationalisation of major industries. There were also the goals of providing efficient public services like: education, health and transport.After a bit of time with the new ideas Britain started to distribute the wealth to the population and came to the conclusion that both sexes should be equal.

                        After the trials and errors of joining the EC, UK needed help and that's how the Treaty of Accession was proposed. As a part of the EFTA UK sent Treaty to Denmamrk, Norway and Ireland. It was the application of Britain to join the EC but if the UK was not accepted in the EC again then the other sides of the treaty would not join the EC. It was signed by Edward Heath in the UK in 1972. The other sides started referendums for the treaty. In Denmark it was accepted with 63.6% voting 'yes' and Ireland the vote was 81.3% voting 'yes'. The only country that couldn't sign the treaty was Norway because the referendum turned out with 53.5% voting against. On 1 January 1973 the three countries became part of the EC. The joining of the EC was during the governance of the Conservative Party which was more Europhile than The Labour Party. In the elections in 1974 The Labour Party won the election with a commitment to renegotiate Britain's terms of membership of the EC. In 1975 they held a referendum on wherther to remain in the EC. The result was negative and 67.2% voted to stay in.</p>
