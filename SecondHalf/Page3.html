            "It is a concept of government in which the state or a well-established network of social institutions plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of citizens."
            
        </p>
        <p class="Texts">
            Or with other words it is a system in which the government tries to help with social problems. That includes services like public education, health and transport.

        <p class="Title">First steps to The Welfare State</p>
        
        <p class="Texts">
            The idea for The Welfare State first came from the <b>Royal Commision into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832</b> which thought that the old law was subject to widespread abuse and promoted idleness and criminality. People's opinion began to change after reports showing that in massive industial cities, between 25% and 35% of the population were living below the poverty line. The introduction of welfare policies began in the 1910s. There were three main groups that were targeted: the young, the old and the working.

                In 1908 </b>The Children and Young Pesons Act 1908</b> was introduced with a set of regulations that became known as the Children's Charter. It:

        <p class="Title">Post-war Years</p>
        <p class="Texts">After the wars the Labour government was elected and as no surpise they set about creating the Welfare State as they were supporting the working class. The difference this time is that they were planning to complete it. The idea of the 'Welfare State' is to let the Central Government together with loacl authorities deal with the social problems and to take responsibility of fixing them. The priority was to maintain a high level of employment through the nationalisation of major industries. There were also the goals of providing efficient public services like: education, health and transport. After a bit of time with the new ideas Britain started to distribute the wealth to the population and came to the conclusion that both sexes should be equal. In 1970 <b>The Equal Pay Act</b> and <b>The Sex Descrimination Act</b> in 1975 were passed. These acts made discrimination of women in the workplace illegal. And almost immediately after that <b>The Race Ralations Act</b> was passed in 1976. which tried to stop the discrimination and racism that emerged in an increasingly meltiethnical society.</p>

        <p>In 1959 The Conservative government started planning on joining the EEC (European Economic Community). The reason for this action was the unsteady economic growth of Britain. They first joined the EFTA (European Free Trade Association) in 1961. After that Britain tried to enter the Common Market but was rejected ny the French Leader Charles De Gualle in 1963. The Reason for that was the close relationship of Britain with Washington. This was a problem as one one of the reasons of creating the EEC was to make it the third superpower between USA ans USSR. But in 1969 after the resignation of Charles De Gualle there was a great opportunity for Britain to join the EEC. Four years after that Britain was officially in the EEC. The United Kingdom subscribed for many policies in the EEC but decided to keep their currency and not change it to euro.
