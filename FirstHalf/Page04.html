            A dictator is a political leader who possesses absolute power. After the First World War dictatorships emerged in some countries. Totalitarian governments found a fertile ground for growth in Russia, Italy, Germany and other countries.

        In Russia the dictatorship started with The Russian Revolution in 1917. <img src="../Images/Picture141.png" class="RightImage HorizontalImage" style="width:20%"> It was a period of political and social revolution. This revolution was between the "Reds" (Bolsheviks) and the "Whites" (counter-revolutionaries). In the end, in 1923 the Reds managed to win the civil war and came to power. The most important outcomes of the revolution were:

            In Italy, Mussolini founded the Fascist party in 1919. He was the Prime Minister <img src="../Images/Picture142.jpg" class="RightImage VerticalImage" style="height: 300px;"> of Italy from 1922 until his deposition in 1943. Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist and 
            knew how to convince people and made them believe in everything he says. he quickly seized all powers of government and transformed Italy into a totalitarian state. But even though he was a good leader of the Fascist party, he was terrible 
            military commander and this was really important in the Second World War.

        <p class='SubTitle'>Germany</p>
        <p class="Texts">
            In Germany, the National Socialist, or Nazi, party came to power in 1933. Adolf Hitler was the same as Mussolini. He managed to convince the people to vote for him. <img src="../Images/Picture143.jpg" class="LeftImage VerticalImage" style="height: 300px;">Thanks to that, his party took the power in Germany. Once in power, he acts quickly and decisively to consolidate his position and achieve a complete dictatorship. Those who dare to speak out against his regime are immediately beaten, arrested, imprisoned or killed. Hitler carefully tried not to harm the interests of strong groups. He carefully pushes the conservatives aside and cautiously controls the radicals . Hitler crushed all political opposition and started to rebuild Germany's armed strength. Even though he was a terrible person as we can see from the Second World War, he managed to improve the economy of German after the tragedy of the First World War.
