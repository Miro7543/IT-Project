            The First World War was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, with an estimated of 40 million casualties. But let's see what are the main factors which led to the First World War.</p>  
        </p>
        <p class="SubTitle">The beginning of the war</p>
        <p class="Texts"> <img src="../Images/Picture124.jpg" class="VerticalImage LeftImage"> The first factor is the european expansionism. The British and French Empires were the world's most powerful and they had expand over the globe. Logically, countries like Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy wanted to have colonies as well and the only way to expand their territories is with war. But the spark that ignited everything and especially the First World War was the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. It all starded back in June 1914, when the heir to the Austrian throne, Franz Ferdinant, was murdered at Sarajevo, Serbia, during an official state visit. After this event, Austria and Germany declared war on Serbia. Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia, and approved partial mobilisation after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade, which was a few kilometres from the border, on 28 July 1914. Then France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia. Germany had a plan called "Blitzkreig", which is to attack and invade France for a short period of time. But for this plan to succeed, Germany had to invade Belgium first in order to get aroung France's defences. And this was the reason Britain joined the war as an ally to France and Russia. Soon half of the nations of the world became involved in the conflict and at this time Europe was split into two camps: the Allied Powers, primarily composed of the British Empire (United Kingdom, Ireland and the British colonies), France, United States, the Russian Empire, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Greece, Serbia and Montenegro and the Central Powers, primarily composed of the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria.
        <p class='SubTitle'>Progress of the war</p>
        <p class="Texts"> After many failures on the part of the Central Powers, they started to weaken. The German advance into France was halted at the Battle of the Marne and the Western Front settled into a war of attrition, marked by a long series of trench lines that continued until 1917. Austria-Hungary invasion through Russia and Serbia was also stopped and the empire needed the help of Germany. The Ottoman Empire faced failures several times fighting with UK and Russia in Asia. There were only successes on the Balkan Peninsula. Bulgaria with the help of Germany and Austria-Hungary managed to capture Serbia and Albania. And then slowly the Central Powers started to lose battle after battle but they did not give up. By the time 1917, everyone was exhausted and waited for the other to surrender. And the first country to leave the war was Russia. There was a tense political relations. There was a civil war and after all the Bolsheviks won it and pulled Russia out of the war. This was great news for Germany because now only had to focus on the western front. However, in 1917 USA decided to join the war with fresh forces. And this was the time when the Central Powers were all pushed back. Bulgaria collapsed first, followed by the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary. And finally on 11 November 1918, Germany surrendered and this was the end of the First World War.</p>
        <p class='SubTitle'>Aftermath</p>
        <p class="Texts"> There were many casualties. Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured. France and UK had the most casualties around 1 million each. In the same year the League of Nations was founded at genewa with the aim of keeping peace nad controlling difficult political situations all over the world.And finally the war caused severe economic consequences from 1919 to 1933, when over three million people in Britain were unemployed. Also all attempts at reconstruction seemed definitely shattered with the 1929 slump and the Wall Street Crash in the USA. The whole of Europe was affected, and became caught in a grip of high inflation and high unemployment. A Peace Treaty was then signed at Versailles in June 1919. The losing countries were shrinked and their territories were devided between the winners. Also they were made to play a fine to the winners for entering the war and taking so many innocent lives.</p>
