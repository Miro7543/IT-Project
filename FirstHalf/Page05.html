            The Second World War was a global war that lasted from 1 September 1939 to 2 September 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's countries forming two opposing military alliances: The Allies (France and Britain, and later Russia and USA) and the Axis powers (Germany, Italy and Japan). Like anything, this war has a reason to happen. The three main causes of the Second World War were:

            World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland with the help of Soviet Union. Then France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany just 2 days after the invasion. In the beginning of the war, more or less nothing had happened. There were attempts for small invasion from France and UK towards Nazi Germany but they were a failure. Then UK tried to stop Sweden and Norway from exporting essential materials to Germany. And the best moment was when Soviet Union attacked Finland. The UK and France landed troops in Norway and wanted to move them across Sweden to help Finland against Soviet Union and then along the way to try to take control of Sweden and stop the exporortation to Germany.

            Japan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor which forced the US to declare war against Japan; the European Axis powers declared war on the US in solidarity.  <img src="../Images/Picture152.jpg" class="HorizontalImage LeftImage">Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned towards Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy.

            World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts, and the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—became the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political integration, especially in Europe, began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense of common identity.
